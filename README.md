<h1>Spore - Custom Asset Types</h1>
(working title)

<p>This is a mod for Spore that aims to add an easy interface for creating new asset types, without needing other mod developers to add any custom code of their own.<br>
Currently, the mod is in an unfinished state, and is not ready for release; see the Issues page for the main reasons why.</p>
