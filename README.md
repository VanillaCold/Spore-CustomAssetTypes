<h1>Spore - Create-a-Type</h1>

<p>This is a mod for Spore that aims to add an easy interface for creating new asset types, without needing other mod developers to add any custom code of their own.<br>
Currently, the mod is not feature-complete; there are some new features I plan to add in the future, though the basic functionality is present.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The mod's source code comes with an example project for use in Sporemodder FX <a href="https://github.com/VanillaCold/Spore-CustomAssetTypes/tree/main/SMFX%20Projects/AssetTypeTemplate">here.</a><br>
In future, when the mod's functionality is complete, I will add a Wiki to this repository for the sake of documetation</p>
